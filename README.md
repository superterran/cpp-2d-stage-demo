# Fantasy Game

This is a little side-project to help learn C++. Loosely based on [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3mtvlk/learn_to_make_a_game_in_c/) which is walking through the [Cave Story](https://store.steampowered.com/app/200900/Cave_Story/) engine. The structure here is actually fairly similar to a js [project](https://github.com/superterran/legend-of-canvas) I did several years ago.
